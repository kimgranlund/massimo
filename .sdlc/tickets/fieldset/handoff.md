## Goal
Base UI parity, wave 1: Fieldset exists in ui-kit for both renderers (web component and React) and passes the geometry review.

## Intent
- Do: Fieldset Root/Legend (no native <fieldset> in web components: role=group + aria-labelledby), disabled propagating to every control inside (data-disabled), spacing from the container ladder.
- Non-goals: new visual language; anything outside this component (shared infrastructure belongs to its own ticket).
- Done when: the component follows the kit pattern (web component + React compound parts with `render` and state `className`, Panda slot recipe, Base UI data-* state attributes, part names and event details), has manifest, guide, examples, contracts and tests, and every item of docs/guides/geometry-review.md is satisfied (enforced items green in `test/geometry-acceptance.test.ts` with no new KNOWN_GAPS; manual items recorded in its verification record).

## Context
- Base UI reference: https://base-ui.com/react/components/fieldset (anatomy, data attributes, props, keyboard).
- Kit pattern and alignment: docs/specs/components.md (State attributes, Part names, Composition), docs/specs/authoring.md, docs/guides/change-a-component.md.
- Geometry acceptance: docs/guides/geometry-review.md; families in packages/ui-kit/contracts/geometry-families.json.
- Show it in the jig: Components page family and a size ladder (apps/studio/src/pages/Components.tsx, shared.tsx SizeLadder).

## Constraints
Zero native form elements in web components; every length from the geometry system; colours from Spectrum roles; motion via intent tokens; class names unhashed; existing components' APIs unchanged.
